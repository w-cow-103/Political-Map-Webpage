# Political-Map-Webpage

### Summary

The goal for this project is to create a webapp similar to *The Council for Foreign Relations's* [Global Conflict Tracker](https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker). 
However, instead of being focused on current international conflicts, this webapp will be focused on highlighting different liberal indices including [The Democracy Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist_Democracy_Index) by *The Economist*. 

### ToDo list

Mostly in order - This list does contain long term goals and aspirations as well. 

 - Publish the website
   - Short Term: Gitlab Pages or Heroku as a quick solution
   - Long Term: Investigate more options and weight them against the status quo
 -  Using Mapbox, create a world map that looks how I want
 -  Create linked pages that allow me to include my own thoughts on the current political climate on a select number of countries
   -  Kinda like a blog, I want the ability to highlight select situations in a few countries where I believe their unique sense of politics is interesting
